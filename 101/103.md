## Estructuras de Datos
>A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data

### Linear Data Structures

1. Arrays
>List of similar values of fixed length

![Array](./img/array.jpg)

2. Linked List
>A linked list is a type of data structure that is easy to expand, contract, and reindex

![LinkedList](./img/linked_list.jpeg)

3. Dictionary
>A dictionary is a general concept that maps unique keys to non-unique values. Go to Browser.

4. Queue
>FIFO Data structure

![Queue](./img/queue.png)

5. Stack
>LIFO Data Structure

![Stack](./img/stack.png)

### Non-Linear Data Structures
1. Graph
>a type of non-linear data structure that is used to store data in the form of nodes and edges

![Graph](./img/grafo.png)

2. Tree
>In computer science, a tree is a widely used abstract data type that represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes

![Tree](./img/tree.png)

## Operaciones de Estructuras de Datos

1. Arrays
- Traverse − print all the array elements one by one.
- Insertion − Adds an element at the given index.
- Deletion − Deletes an element at the given index.
- Search − Searches an element using the given index or by the value.
- Update − Updates an element at the given index.

2. Linked lists
- Insert
    - At beginning
    - At the end
    - At a random point
- Delete
    - At beginning
    - At the end
    - At a random point

3. Dictionary
- Access value by key
- Iterate through the dictionary
- Has Key value
- Remove

4. Queue
- Queue
- Dequeue

5. Stack
- push(): Adds a single or multiple items to the top of the Stack.
- pop(): Removes and Returns the top item of the Stack.
- peek(): Returns the top item of the Stack.
- isEmpty(): Returns True if Stack is empty, False otherwise.
- clear(): Removes all the items from the Stack.
- size(): Returns the length of the stack.

## Programacion Orientada a Objetos
>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach based on objects and classes. The object-oriented paradigm allows us to organise software as a collection of objects that consist of both data/attributes and behaviours.

- Attributes

- Behaviour
    - Internal
    - Public

- Static methods
>A static method is part of a class definition, but is not part of the objects it creates.

- Inheritance
![Inheritance](./img/inheritance.png)

- Abstraction
>Hiding unnecessary details and functionalities and only showing what is important to work is an abstraction.

- Polymorphism
>To execute a single task in various ways is called polymorphism. For example, “to speak” is a method but is performed differently: a dog barks, a human speaks, a cat meows, a bird chirp, etc.

- Encapsulation
>the process of hiding and securing the properties of objects

![OOP](./img/oop.jpeg)

### Excercises

1. Make a Person Walk
    - Make a person class
    - With attributes of height, weight, dob, name
    - With methods of getting his age
    - Walking
    - Say something
2. Have a bunch of animals
    - Base class Animal with basic attributes
        string animalType
        makeASound
    - Implement on Bird, Dog and Person

## Relationships

- One to One

![one_to_one](./img/one_to_one.png)

- One to Many

![one_to_many](./img/one_to_many.png)

- Many to Many

![many_to_many](./img/many_to_many.png)

- Polymorphic

![polymorphism](./img/poly.png)

## Examples
- Biblioteca
- Tienda en Linea

# Web Programming Intro
>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services

>TCP/IP

![http](./img/http.png)

## MVC
> Model, View, Controller

> pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic

![mvc](./img/mvc.png)

### Model => Objects
>Representation of our objects

### Views => Visual Representation
>How the final user sees the data

### Controller => Routing, Permissions, Auth
>How the data gets delivered

## APIs
>Application Programming Interface

>You want to access the same data in many different places or ways

### Type of Actions
- GET
- POST
- PUT
- DELETE

### Type of params
- Query
- Body
- Url

## Basic HTML

## Basic CSS

## Basic JS
